For the 2019 [APTOS blindness detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) on Kaggle, me and [Choqs](https://github.com/Choqs) worked on a notebook to see how we could perform on our first challenge with the little time we had.

This notebook's goal was to pratice what we learned on an "real-life" and interesting project, and is not a well-driven, well-designed and optimized project. But we are still glad of what we achieved and this README is here to explain what we did and why?
